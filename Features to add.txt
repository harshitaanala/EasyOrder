For your project, a fitting name could be **"QuickBill"** or **"EasyOrder"**. Here are some features you could add to it:

### Features:
1. **Dynamic Menu**: Allow the user to update the menu with new items, remove existing ones, or adjust prices without modifying the code.
2. **Multiple Orders**: Enable users to place multiple orders in a session and calculate their respective subtotals, taxes, and totals.
3. **Custom Tax Rate**: Add an option to let users input a custom tax rate (instead of the fixed 15%) for more flexibility.
4. **Discounts**: Offer a discount feature where users can apply a discount percentage to the total amount before tax.
5. **Payment Options**: Add a basic payment module that allows users to choose between different payment methods (e.g., cash, card).
6. **Receipt Generation**: Automatically generate a detailed receipt at the end of the order, including the menu, subtotal, tax, discount, and total.
7. **Order History**: Store previous orders and their details so users can view their past orders or reorder easily.
8. **Custom Order Quantity**: Allow users to select the quantity of items in the order.
9. **User Authentication**: Add a login system to track orders by customer name or email.
10. **Graphical Summary**: Visual representation of the order (e.g., bar chart showing the breakdown of costs: menu items, subtotal, tax, total).

This project would be great for showcasing your ability to work with user inputs, calculations, and potentially even integrating with a database for order tracking.
